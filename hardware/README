Quick Explanation:
% eagle-makefile
% make

---

To install, simply copy the three included executables to your $PATH. You can then use:
% eagle-makefile
in any directory with an EAGLE file set (.sch and .brd) to generate a Makefile.

In order to use, the 'eagle' binary must be in your $PATH.

The makefile gives you several different targets:

all: (equivelant to just typing 'make')
	Generates the doc and freedfm-package targets.

doc: (requires LaTeX)
	Generates a postscript file with all of the board layers and all schematic pages.

freedfm-package:
	Generates a zip file with a gerber file for each important layer:
		- Top Copper
		- Bottom Copper
		- Top Silkscreen
		- Bottom Silkscreen
		- Top Soldermask
		- Bottom Soldermask
		- NC Drill
	This zip package can then be submitted to freedfm.com or a PCB fabrication service.
